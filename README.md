# Before you begin
Make sure you have registered a license key on the [Cfx.re Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) service. You need to have the IP match the IP on which you're going to first use the key. Afterwards, the key can be used on any IP, but only on one server at a time.

##Prerequisites

1. [Visual C++ Redistributable 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) or newer.
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to assure a correct installation.
