# Installation

1. Create a new directory (for example `D:\FXServer\server`), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the current recommended `master` branch build for Windows from the [artifacts server](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).
3. Extract the build into the directory previously created.
3b. Use any archiving tool (such as WinRAR or 7-Zip).
